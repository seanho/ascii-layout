# ASCII Layout

Generate simple layout in text, because not everyone is using Storyboard for previewing layout.

It all started from this [tweet](https://twitter.com/lexrus/status/765798277598117889)

Check out the demo [here](https://seanho.github.io/ascii-layout/). Have fun!

### Disclaimer

This tool is not meant to generate complex layout, so use it wisely. And as a matter of fact, if the layout is too complicated to be represented using this tool, you might want to review your information architecture (e.g. are you showing too much information for your user?) or consider breaking down the view into small subviews to help others to reason about the component's high level layout.
